- **Name:** Nawapon Somruang

Welcome to the **Check it off Anti-Fake News System** project.  
This project is designed to help identify and manage fake news using modern web technologies.  

<br>

## About the Project  
This web application allows users to:  

- Fetch news data from a database using both **Google Sheets API** and **`db.json`**.  
  > I experimented with using Google Sheets API in addition to `db.json` to ensure that the data can be updated dynamically while keeping a local backup.  

- The **Home Page** collects news data and connects to the API or local JSON to fetch the latest information.  

- The **Detail Page** allows users to read the full details of each news article.  
  - This page provides **Two Functions**:  
    - **Go to Vote Page** ‚Üí where users can submit their feedback.  
    - **View Comments** ‚Üí where users can read opinions and comments shared by others.  

- The **Vote Page** is designed to collect user feedback by allowing them to submit their name, vote choice, comments, and an image link.  

- User **comments** are displayed on the website so visitors can see shared opinions and reasoning.  

- News articles are classified as **real or fake** based on user votes:  
  - If **upvotes > downvotes ‚Üí** the news is considered **real**  
  - If **downvotes > upvotes ‚Üí** the news is considered **fake**  

- Both **upvote and downvote counts are visible on every page**, ensuring users always see the current credibility of each news item.  

- Results are updated **in real-time** on the website, showing the latest classifications, vote counts, and comments instantly ‚Äî without needing to refresh the page.

## Justification: Why use Next.js

- I chose to use **Next.js** for this project because I initially misunderstood the requirement and thought that the assignment needed to be developed as a web-based application.  
   Based on that understanding, I decided to use Next.js, since it is a powerful framework for building modern web applications.

- Next.js provides features such as **server-side rendering**, **dynamic routing**, and **easy API integration**, which made it a strong choice for implementing the functions I planned for this project.  
   Although my initial decision was based on a misunderstanding, I later found that using Next.js actually helped me learn many useful concepts and allowed me to complete the project in a structured way.

- I sincerely ask for your kind understanding, as I have worked on this project entirely by myself and take full responsibility for it.  
   Even though there were many challenges along the way, I put in my best effort to make it work as effectively as possible.


üôè I humbly hope for the professor's consideration and support as I present my work.

## Technologies Used  

The project is built with **Next.js** and uses the following tools:  

- **Next.js** ‚Äì for server-side rendered and static web applications  
- **React** ‚Äì for component-based UI development  
- **Node.js & npm** ‚Äì for running the server and managing packages  
- **Vercel** ‚Äì for deployment  
- **db.json** ‚Äì (JSON-based database for storing sample data, optional)
